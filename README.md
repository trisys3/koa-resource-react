# koa-resource-react
## Experimental reactive koa middleware resembling JSX

> NOTE: This middleware is very experimental. It is meant to be an inspiration
> for myself & others. If something else comes out of it, whether by me or
> someone else, great! If not, the experience will (hopefully) be a good one.
> That being said, the middleware is meant to work, so if you find something
> wrong with it, please [open an issue](issues) and I will try to fix it or
> guide you on how to fix it.
